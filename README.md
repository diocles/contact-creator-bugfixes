# Contact Creator Bugfixes

This plugin applies small fixes to the behaviour of the UK Labour
Party's system "Contact Creator", available at
https://www.contactcreator.org.uk/, to enable compatibility with
Mozilla Firefox.

Currently (Dec 2015). it replaces the menu links with non-Javascript
URLs, to avoid an exception that is being thrown by a piece of JS code
when you click the menu buttons.

Hopefully this extension will become obsolete in 2016, when the system
gets fixed to be cross-browser compatible!

Please note that this is not officially endorsed or supported by the
Contact Creator team in any way.

This extension works in both Firefox and Firefox for Android.
